# Project-1: Real Estate Lending Market Analysis (Insert Presentation Title)

#### Contributors: Jackie Bai, Rosalyn Brown & Thomas Scott

#### Primary Libraries Used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn & Bokeh

#### APIs Used: Quandl & Alpaca

### Summary of Findings
In this project, we sought to utilize datasets from Fannie Mae, the St. Louis Fed, Yale University as well as the trading platform Alpaca to create a clear picture of the mortgage industry since the beginning of the new millenium. We wanted to see whether today's lending environment resembled that of the 2000s given that low interest rates preceded an asset bubble which finally burst in 2008. After that crisis as well as during the pandemic, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates through a program known as quantitative easing to stave off deflation. We wanted to see whether or not these low interest rates would in turn lead to another housing bubble in spite of enhanced underwriting standards on the part of lenders as well as agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Instead what we found is that we now have a K-shape housing boom. Tightened underwriting standards in concert with low interest rates have lead to soaring single-family home prices in which only well-healed qualifying buyers can be competitive. We also noticed that the market remains highly cyclical. Finally, we observed that *low interest rates correlate directly to soaring single-family housing prices*, which in turn *lead to degraded loan quality*.

## Key Objectives

#### Evaluate the following questions:
- What is the impact of low interest rates on the housing market?
- What is the impact of low interest rates on loan quality overall?
- What correlations exist between low interest rates and other data points?
- What is the impact of low interest rates on mortgage backed securities?

### Recommendations:
- Maintain current underwriting standards and seek out ways to tighten them.
- Enhance monitoring of loans on investment properties and cash out refinances.
- Seek out ways to enhance returns on mortgage backed securities in a low interest rate environment
- Evaluate ways to improve access to financing for middle-income borrowers without compromising the bank's overall portfolio.
