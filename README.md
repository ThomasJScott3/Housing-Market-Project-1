# Project-1: Real Estate Lending Market Analysis (Insert Presentation Title)

#### Contributors: Jackie Bai, Rosalyn Brown & Thomas Scott

#### Primary Libraries Used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn & Bokeh

#### APIs Used: Quandl & Alpaca

### Summary of Findings
In this project, we sought to utilize datasets from Fannie Mae, the St. Louis Fed, Yale University as well as the trading platform Alpaca to create a clear picture of the mortgage industry since the beginning of the new millenium. We wanted to see whether today's lending environment resembled that of the 2000s given that low interest rates preceded an asset bubble which finally burst in 2008. After that crisis as well as during the pandemic, the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates through a program known as quantitative easing to stave off deflation. We wanted to see whether or not these low interest rates would in turn lead to another housing bubble in spite of enhanced underwriting standards on the part of lenders as well as agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Instead what we found is that we now have a K-shape housing boom (INSERT AXIOS ARTICLE LINK). Tightened underwriting standards in concert with low interest rates and have lead to soaring single-family home prices, ushering in a highly competitive housing market in which only well-healed qualifying buyers can be competitive. In addition, we observed that *low interest rates correlate directly to soaring single-family housing prices*, which in turn *lead to degraded loan quality* as well as *stagnating returns for mortgage backed securities*.

### Key Objectives
Evaluate the following questions:
- What is the impact of low interest rates on the housing market?
- What is the impact of low interest rates on loan quality overall?
- What correlations exist between low interest rates and other data points?
- What is the impact of low interest rates on mortgage backed securities?

### Recommendations:
