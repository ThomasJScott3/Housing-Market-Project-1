## Glossary for: Historical Origination Profile by Orig. Vintage

This table shows origination characteristics of all UPB in the Fannie Mae Single-Family Loan Performance Dataset.

-Average Origination UPB:
The average of the original amount of the mortgage loans in the selection as indicated by the mortgage documents.

-Borrower Credit Score
A numerical value used by the financial services industry to evaluate the quality of borrower credit. Credit scores are typically based on a proprietary statistical model that is developed for use by credit data repositories. These credit repositories apply the model to borrower credit information to arrive at a credit score. When this term is used by Fannie Mae, it is referring to the "classic" FICO score developed by Fair Isaac Corporation. (AKA Borrower or Co-Borrower Credit Score).

-Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio
A ratio calculated at origination derived by dividing the borrower's total monthly obligations (including housing expense) by his or her stable monthly income. This calculation is used to determine the mortgage amount for which a borrower qualifies.

-Loan Purpose
An indicator that denotes if a mortgage loan in a pool is either a purchase money mortgage or refinance mortgage. Mortgage loans that were modified prior to delivery in lieu of refinance and then delivered to Fannie Mae are disclosed as "refinance".

-Occupancy Status
An indicator that denotes how the borrower used the mortgaged property at the origination date of the mortgage (principal residence, second home or investment property).

-Original Combined Loan-to-Value (OCLTV)
A ratio calculated at the time of origination for a mortgage loan. The CLTV reflects the loan-to-value ratio inclusive of all loans secured by a mortgaged property on the origination date of the underlying mortgage loan. (AKA Original Combined Loan-to-Value).

-Original Interest Rate
The original interest rate on a mortgage loan as identified in the original mortgage loan documents.

-Original Loan-to-Value (OLTV)
A ratio calculated at the time of origination for a mortgage loan. The Original LTV reflects the loan-to-value ratio of the loan amount secured by a mortgaged property on the origination date of the underlying mortgage loan.

-Original Unpaid Principal Balance (UPB)
The sum of the original amount of the mortgage loans in the selection as indicated by the mortgage documents.

-Origination Vintage
The year that the mortgage note was issued

-Risk Layers
Risk Layers are based upon loan conditions that typically relate to higher likelihood of default or loss. The four risk layers are: Investment Property, debt-to-income greater than 45% or unknown, FICO < 680, and cash-out refinance. Each condition met will add a risk layer to the loan.
